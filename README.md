## What challenges were faced and how were they resolved

1. Parsing the csv file into an array of structures using pass by reference.
 
        by studying the csv file handling forums,pages and looking through all resources, understanding the structure and pattern of file and also how file handling tools work.

2. How to retrieve the data of the structure to execute the program successfully
 
        With the help of some resources on pointer to structure array and dynamic memory allocation, the task was successfully carried out.

3. How to access files located in different folders and directories
 
        With  the  help of relative path and command line executions to get clear understanding of the directory detection.
